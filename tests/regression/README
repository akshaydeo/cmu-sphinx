This directory contains the scripts that execute the S4 regression
tests.  

Here are some simple instructions.


Requirements:

  - Usual set of gnu/unix tools (gawk/perl/cvs/mailx) must be in your path
  - NIST align program must be your path.
  - a script called 'scvs' in your path that points to the sourecode
    repository.  A typical implementation of scvs would look like
    this:

  export CVS_RSH='/usr/dist/exe/ssh' 
  cvs -z3 -d:ext:lamere@cvs.cmusphinx.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx $*

 - To add or remove a test from the regression tests, edit the
   'runAllTests' script

 - To add or remove people from the email notification list edit the
   'mailReport' script.
