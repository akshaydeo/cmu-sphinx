This directory contains the scripts that execute the S4 regression
tests.  

Here are some simple instructions.


Requirements:

  - Usual set of gnu/unix tools (gawk/perl/cvs/mailx) must be in your path
  - NIST align program must be your path.
  - a script called 'scvs' in your path that points to the sourecode
    repository.  A typical implementation of scvs would look like
    this:

  export CVS_RSH='/usr/dist/exe/ssh' 
  cvs -z3 -d:ext:lamere@cvs.cmusphinx.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx $*

    Since the regression tests access the repository, you will need to setup 
    your public keys properly so that no password is required to checkin or
    checkout.

 - To add or remove a test from the regression tests, edit the
   'runAllTests' script

 - To add or remove people from the email notification list edit the
   'mailReport' script.


 - To setup a nightly regression test, run the script 'regressionTest' 
   from a crontab job. Make sure that paths are setup properly.  Here
   is an example entry:

   0 22 * * * (. $HOME/.profile ; ./regressionTest)

 - Here is the associated profile. Make sure that path is exported


PATH=$PATH:"$HOME/bin:/lab/speech/bin:/usr/dist/exe:/pkg/gnu/bin:/lab/speech/java/j2sdk1.4.0/bin::/lab/speech/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/lab/speech/java/j2sdk1.4.0/bin:."
export PATH
