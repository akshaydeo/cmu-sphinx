	<b>NOTE:</b> To build and run some parts of this demo, you must <a href="../../doc/jsapi_setup.html">setup JSAPI</a>.

      <p>
	This is a very simple program that shows the basic speech recognition
	capabilities of Sphinx-4. When you run the program, the following
	GUI shows up:
      <p>
	<center><img src="live.jpg"></center>
      <p>
	As you can see, the program prompts you to say a certain sentence,
	and you tell the program when you start to speak. You can select
	the different tasks in the "Decoder:" selection box. The text you
	should say is in the "Say:" box. The recognition results are in
	the "Recognized:" box.
      <p>
	You can run this program in three different modes:
      <ul>
	<li><b>Click to start, click to stop.</b> <br>In this mode, you click
	  the "Speak" button to start speaking, and click the "Stop"
	  button to stop speaking.
	<li><b>Click to talk (endpointed).</b> <br>In this mode, you click the
	  "Speak" button to start speaking. The endpointer will automatically
	  detect the end of speech and stop the recognition.
	<li><b>Hands free mode</b> <br>In this mode, you click the "Speak"
	  button only once. You then start speaking, wait for it to perform
	  recognition, then click the "Next" button to go to the next
	  sentence, start speaking, etc.. The endpointer will detect
	  the utterance boundaries.  Finally, when you are done
	  with all the utterances, click "Stop".
      </ul>
