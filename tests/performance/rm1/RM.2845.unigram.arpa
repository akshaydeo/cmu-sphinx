This is a 1-gram language model, based on a vocabulary of 993 words,
  which begins "</s>", "<s>", "A"...
This is an OPEN-vocabulary model (type 1)
  (OOVs were mapped to UNK, which is treated as any other vocabulary word)
Absolute discounting was applied.
1-gram discounting constant : 0.395349
This file is in the ARPA-standard format introduced by Doug Paul.

p(wd3|wd1,wd2)= if(trigram exists)           p_3(wd1,wd2,wd3)
                else if(bigram w1,w2 exists) bo_wt_2(w1,w2)*p(wd3|wd2)
                else                         p(wd3|w2)

p(wd2|wd1)= if(bigram exists) p_2(wd1,wd2)
            else              bo_wt_1(wd1)*p_1(wd2)

All probs and back-off weights (bo_wt) are given in log10 form.
