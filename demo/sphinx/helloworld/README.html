      <p>
      This is a simple command line program that shows how to
      write a simple Sphinx-4 application that recognizes connected
      digits, using a BNF-style grammar. You can run it in two modes:
      with or without endpointing. When you run the demo without endpointing,
      the following will appear:
      </p>
      <pre>
Say any digit(s): e.g. "two oh oh four", "three six five".
Start speaking. Press ENTER when you finish speaking.

You said: one two three four

Start speaking. Press ENTER when you finish speaking.

You said: four two one one four

Start speaking. Press ENTER when you finish speaking.
      </pre>
      <p>
      It expects you to say a sequence of digits, and press ENTER when you
      finish speaking. The recognition results will then be shown, 
      and you will be prompted to say another sequence of digits. 
      When you want to quit the demo, simply press Ctrl-C.
      </p>
      <p>
      When you run the demo with endpointing, you do not have to press
      ENTER when you finish speaking. The endpointer will automatically
      detect the end of an utterance:
      Say any digit(s): e.g. "two oh oh four", "three six five".
      </p>
      <pre>
Say any digit(s): e.g. "two oh oh four", "three six five".
Start speaking. Press Ctrl-C to quit.

You said: one two three four

Start speaking. Press Ctrl-C to quit.

You said: four five six nine

Start speaking. Press Ctrl-C to quit.
      </pre>
      <h3>Building</h3>
      <p>To build this demo, merely type the following in a shell from
         any directory in the Sphinx-4 hierarchy:
	 <ul>
	 <code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
	 </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      Doing so will create <code>bld/bin/HelloWorld.jar</code> and 
      <code>bld/bin/HelloDigits.jar</code> under the 
      top level directory.  You can run the demo using <code>java -jar</code> 
      (see "Running" below).
      </p>
      <h3>Running</h3>
      <p>
      First make sure that you have
      <a href="../../../javadoc/edu/cmu/sphinx/jsapi/doc-files/jsapi_setup.html">JSAPI setup</a> correctly. Then, make sure that all the Sphinx-4 classes 
      are built. Go to the top level directory (sphinx4) and type:
      </p>
      <code>
      ant all
      </code>
      <p>
      To run the demo without the endpointer, go to the <b>top level 
      directory</b> and type: 
      </p>
      <code>sphinx4> java -jar bld/bin/HelloWorld.jar</code>
      <p>
      To run this demo with the endpointer, go to the <b>top level 
      directory</b> and type:
      </p>
      <code>
      <br>sphinx4> java -jar bld/bin/HelloDigits.jar</code>
      </code>
      <p>
      <font color="FF0000"><b>NOTE:</b></font> Make sure that you are using
      Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.4 or higher.
