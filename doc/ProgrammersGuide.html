  This tutorial shows you how to write Sphinx-4 applications. We will
  start with an overview of the Sphinx-4 system, with just enough depth
  so that you can use to build applications, but without the full-blown
  details. After that, we will use the Hello World!
  demo as an example to show how a simple application can be written.
  We will then proceed to a more complex example. Consequently,
  this tutorial into the following parts:

  <p>
  In this section, we will provide an overview of the Sphinx-4 system,
  starting from an overview of HMM-based recognizers. We will highlight
  in <s4keyword>red</s4keyword> those keywords that are 
  critical to understanding Sphinx-4.
  </p>

  <p>
  <h3><a name="hmmRecognizers">Overview of an HMM-based Speech Recognition System</a></h3>
  <p>
  Sphinx-4 is an HMM-based speech recognizer. <s4keyword>HMM</s4keyword>
  stands for Hidden Markov Models, which is a type of statistical model.
  In HMM-based systems,
  each unit of sound (usually called a phoneme) is represented by a statistical
  model that represents the distribution of all the evidence (data) for
  that phoneme. This is called the <s4keyword>acoustic model</s4keyword> 
  for that phoneme.
  The speech signals are first transformed into a sequence of vectors
  that represent certain characteristics of the signal, and the
  parameters of the acoustic model are then estimated using these vectors
  (usually called <s4keyword>features</s4keyword>). This process is called 
  training the acoustic models.
  </p>
  <p>
  During speech recognition, features are derived from the 
  incoming speech (we will use "speech" to mean the same thing as "audio")
  in the same way as in the training process. The component of the recognizer
  that generates these features is called the <s4keyword>front end</s4keyword>.
  These live features are scored against the acoustic model.
  The <s4keyword>score</s4keyword> obtained indicates how 
  likely that a particular set of features (extracted from live
  audio) belongs to the particular phoneme of the corresponding model.
  </p>
  <p>
  The process of speech recognition is to find the best possible sequence
  of words (or units) that will fit the given input speech. It is a 
  <s4keyword>search</s4keyword> problem, and in the case of HMM-based 
  recognizers, a graph search problem. The graph represents all possible
  sequences of phonemes in the entire <s4keyword>language</s4keyword>
  of the task under consideration. The graph is typically a very large
  HMM, composed of the HMMs of sound units concatenated in a guided manner,
  as specified by the <s4keyword>grammar</s4keyword> of the task.
