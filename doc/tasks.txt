Task and performance targets:
----------------------------

We identified 4 types of tasks we would like the resulting system to
support.  We also identified rough performance targets based on the
performance of the existing Sphinx system, and categorized the task
performance in terms of "live" vs. "batch" mode.  The considerations
for the "live" and "batch" modes are the following:

    Live:  Uses streaming data
           Has no access to the future and limited access to the past
	   Needs automatic gain control and end pointing
	   For testing, can be simulated by streaming data from a file

    Batch: Has access to the entire utterance
	   Can normalize cepstral data over entire audio span
	   End pointing is already done
	       	       
We chose the tasks to provide a broad spectrum of recognition tasks.
In order of complexity, the tasks are as follows:

The target system for performance is Solaris 8 on a SunBlade 1000 with
dual 750MHz UltraSPARC III processors with 8MB cache each, 512MB main
memory, and 36GB internal disk.


Task 1 (isolated digits):
------------------------

  Purpose:

    o Test the infrastructure:  front end, batch/live CMN, acoustic
      model loading and scoring, simple search, etc.
    o Get some initial understanding of speed and accuracy and gather
      base line measurements.

  Performance Goals:

    o Speed    < 1X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 95%

  Environment:

    o Very small vocabulary
    o Word-based phones for acoustic model
    o Trivial grammar
    o Static sentence HMMs
    o Simple search

  Notes:

    Acoustic model of word-dependent basephones and cross-word
    triphones and 3-state HMMs (8 Gaussians per HMM state), trained
    with the clean component of the AURORA2 (a connected-digits task)
    database.

    Testing data comes from TI46.

    Also run forced alignment against test data for both Sphinx 3
    and Sphinx 3J as a sanity check.


Task 2a (connected digits):
--------------------------

  Purpose:

    o "Epsilon" step beyond isolated digits.  Our first attempt at
      continuous speech recognition.  
    
  Performance Goals:

    o Speed    < 1X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 95%

  Environment:

    o All of Task 1 environment
    o Simple "looping" grammar
    o Introduce word/silence insertion penalties


Task 2b (connected digits with composite senones):
-------------------------------------------------

  Purpose:

    o Introduce the creation/use of composite senones.

  Performance Goals:

    o Speed    < 1X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 95%

  Environment:

    o All of task 2a, but also use crossword triphones.


Task 2c (connected digits with dynamic sentence HMMs):
-----------------------------------------------------

  Purpose:

    o Investigate creating/modifying sentence HMMs during the search.
    o Better understand performance/accuracy with dynamic sentence HMMs     

  Performance Goals:

    o Speed    < 1X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 95%

  Environment:

    o All of task 2b.


Task 3a (command and control with small vocabulary):
---------------------------------------------------

  Purpose:

    o Permit vocabulary other than just digits (e.g., triphones as 
      opposed to word based phones).
    o Permit C&C grammars.
    o Possibly raise new issued with dynamic sentence HMMs

  Performance Goals:
  
    o Speed    <= 1X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 80%

  Environment:

    o Task 2c environment with following exceptions:
      o Triphone-based phones for acoustic model.
      o "Restricted" CFG.
    o Introduce support for C&C grammar format of some type (e.g., 
      CFG based on VoiceXML SRGF).
    o Create FSA (or something) interface to Linguist?
    o Introduce cross word data.


Task 3b (command and control with small-to-medium vocabulary):
-------------------------------------------------------------

  Purpose:

    o Same as 3a, but introduce a larger vocabulary (1000 - 5000 words).
    o Better understand performance and accuracy with larger vocabulary
    o Improve the search through ...

  Performance Goals:
  
    o Speed    <= 1X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 80%

  Notes:

    o Task 3a with larger vocabulary.


Task 4 (large vocabulary dictation):
------------------------------------

  Purpose:

    o Large to very large vocabulary (30K+)
    o Support n-Gram language models.
    o Better understand performance and accuracy
    o Improve search through...

  Performance Goals:
  
    o Speed    <= 5.5X Real Time
    o Accuracy > 75%

  Notes:

    o This will also introduce an FSA (or something) to support n-Gram
      grammars.
