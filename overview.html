Sphinx-4 is a speech recognition system written entirely in the
Java(TM) programming language.

<p>
The diagram below shows the general architecture of Sphinx-4, followed by
a description of each block:

<br><i>Figure 1: Architecture diagram of Sphinx-4.</i>

<p>

<b>Recognizer</b> - Contains the main components of Sphinx-4, which are
the front end, the linguist, and the decoder. The application interacts
with the Sphinx-4 system mainly via the Recognizer.

<p>
<b>Audio</b> - The data to be decoded. This is audio in most systems,
but it can also be configured to accept other forms of data,
e.g., spectral or cepstral data.


<p>
<b>Front End</b> - Performs digital signal processing (DSP) on the incoming data.


<p>
<b>Feature</b> - The output of the front end are features, 
which are used for decoding in the rest of the system.


<p>
<b>Linguist</b> - Embodies the linguistic knowledge of the system, which are
the acoustic model, the dictionary, and the language model.
The linguist produces a search graph structure on which the search manager
performs search using different algorithms.


<p>
<b>Search Graph</b> - The graph structure produced by the linguist according
to certain criteria (e.g., the grammar), using knowledge from the dictionary,
the acoustic model, and the language model.


<p>
<b>Decoder</b> - Contains the components necessary for decoding, e.g.,
the search algorithm (search manager), the feature scorer and the pruner.


<p>
<b>Search Manager</b> - Performs search using certain algorithm used, e.g.,
breadth-first search, best-first search, depth-first search, etc..


<p>
<b>Active List</b> - A list of tokens representing all the states in the
search graph that are active in the current feature frame.


<p>
<b>Scorer</b> - Scores the current feature frame against all the active
states in the ActiveList.


<p>
<b>Pruner</b> - Prunes the active list according to certain strategies.


<p>
<b>Result</b> - The decoded result, which usually contains the N-best results.
