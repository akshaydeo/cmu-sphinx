Sphinx-4 is a speech recognition system written entirely in the
Java(TM) programming language.

<p>
The diagram below shows the general architecture of Sphinx-4, followed by
a description of each block:

<table border="1">

<tr>
<td valign="top">Recognizer</td>
<td>Contains the main components of Sphinx-4, which are
the front end, the linguist, and the decoder. The application interacts
with the Sphinx-4 system mainly via the Recognizer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Audio</td>
<td>The data to be decoded. This is audio in most systems,
but it can also be configured to accept other forms of data,
e.g., spectral or cepstral data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Front End</td>
<td>Performs digital signal processing (DSP) on the incoming data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Feature</td>
<td>The output of the front end are features, 
which are used for decoding in the rest of the system.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Linguist</td>
<td>Embodies the linguistic knowledge of the system, which are
the acoustic model, the dictionary, and the language model.
The linguist produces a search graph structure on which the search manager
performs search using different algorithms.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Search Graph</td>
<td>The graph structure produced by the linguist according
to certain criteria (e.g., the grammar), using knowledge from the dictionary,
the acoustic model, and the language model.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Decoder</td>
<td>Contains the components necessary for decoding, e.g.,
the search algorithm (search manager), the feature scorer and the pruner.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Search Manager</td>
<td>Performs search using certain algorithm used, e.g.,
breadth-first search, best-first search, depth-first search, etc..</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Active List</td>
<td>A list of tokens representing all the states in the
search graph that are active in the current feature frame.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Scorer</td>
<td>Scores the current feature frame against all the active
states in the ActiveList.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Pruner</td>
<td>Prunes the active list according to certain strategies.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Result</td>
<td>The decoded result, which usually contains the N-best results.</td>
</tr>
