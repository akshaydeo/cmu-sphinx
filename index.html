<h2>General Information about Sphinx-4</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a name="what_is_sphinx4"><b>Introduction</b></a>
      <p>Sphinx-4 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system
	 written entirely in the Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup>
	 programming language.
         It was created via a joint collaboration between Carnegie
         Mellon's Sphinx group, Sun Microsystems, Mitsubishi Electric
         Research Lab (MERL), and Hewlett Packard (HP), with
         contributions from the University of California at Santa
         Cruz (UCSC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
         (MIT).

      <p>Sphinx-4 started out as a port of Sphinx-3 to the
         Java(TM) programming language, but evolved into a recognizer
         designed to be much more flexible than Sphinx-3, thus
         becoming an excellent platform for speech research.

  <li><a name="speed_and_accuracy"><b>Performance</b></a>
      <p>Sphinx-4 is a very flexible system capable of performing many
         different types of recognition tasks.  As such, it is
         difficult to characterize the performance and accuracy of
         Sphinx-4 with just a few simple numbers such as speech and
         accuracy.  Instead, we regularly run regression tests on
         Sphinx-4 to determine how it performs under a variety of
         tasks.  These tasks and their latest results are as follows
         (each task is progressively more difficult than the previous
	 task):
      <ul>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/IsolatedDigitsResults.html">
              Isolated Digits (TI46)</a>: Runs Sphinx-4 with pre-recorded
              test data to gather performance metrics for recognizing
              just one word at a time.  The vocabulary is merely the
              spoken digits from 0 through 9, with a single utterance
              containing just one digit.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ConnectedDigitsResults.html">
              Connected Digits (TIDIGITS)</a>: Extends the Isolated
              Digits test to recognize more than one word at a time
              (i.e., continuous speech).  The vocabulary is merely the
              spoken digits from 0 through 9, with a single utterance
              containing a
	      sequence of digits.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/SmallVocabResults.html">
              Small Vocabulary (AN4)</a>: Extends the vocabulary
	      to approximately 100 words, with input data ranging
	      from speaking words as well as spelling words out
	      letter by letter.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/MediumVocabResults.html">

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>

<li><a name="download_and_install"><b>Downloading and Installing</b></a>

      <p>Sphinx-4 has been build and tested on the Solaris<sup> <font
      size="-1">TM</font></sup> Operating Environment, Mac OS X, Linux
      and Win32 operating systems. Running, building, and testing 
      Sphinx-4 requires additional software. Before you start, 
      you will need the following software available on your machine.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.4</b> or better. 
      Go to <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>,
      and select "J2SE". Download the latest version. At the time of writing,
      the latest version is 1.4.2.
      </li>

  <br>
  <li><b>Ant 1.6.0</b> or better, available at <a
  href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a>. The site has a manual with instructions on how to download, install, and use ant. The gist of it, just to get started:
  <ul>
  <li> On <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a> click on
  "binary distributions" under "Download", on the left-hand side.
  </li>

  <li> Go to the title "Current release of ant", and select the
  archive file of your preference. The most common formats are
  "tar.gz" and "zip". Clicking on any of them should start downloading
  the file to your machine.
  </li>
  <li> Save the file locally, and extract the files from the
  archive. On Windows machines, clicking on the archive file should
  start "WinZip". On Unix/Linux machines, depending on which file you
  chose, you'll need to "unzip" or "gunzip" and subsequently "tar xf"
  the file.
  </li>
  <li> After extracting the files from the archive, you'll get a
  directory named something like "apache-ant-1.6.0". Rename this
  directory to "ant", and move it to a convenient location. On Windows
  machines, this location is usually "c:\ant". On Unix/linux, this
  location is usually "/usr/local/ant".
  </li>
  <li> Define variables to support ant. This will depend on your platform:
  <ul>
  <li> Windows
  <pre>
set ANT_HOME=c:\ant
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li> Unix (bash)
  <pre>
export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/ant
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Unix (csh)
  <pre>
setenv ANT_HOME /usr/local/ant
set path=( $path $ANT_HOME/bin )

</pre>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Installation of ant is completed.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <br>
  <li> <b>CVS</b> and <b>SSH</b>, but only if you want to interact directly
  with the cvs tree (which we recommend). The canonical places to get them 
  are <a href="http://www.cvshome.org">www.cvshome.org</a> and
  <a href="http://openssh.org">openssh.org</a>. If you are using Windows,
  your best choice is to install <a
  href="http://cygwin.com">cygwin</a>, which will give you a
  linux-like environment in a command prompt window. Make sure to
  choose "ssh" and "cvs" when you install cygwin.
  </li>
</ul>

<li><a name="language_models"><b>Language Models</b></a>

</li>


<br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="create_javadocs"><b>Creating Javadocs</b></a>

<p>
If you want to build the javadocs, go to the top level directory ("sphinx4"),
and type:
</p>
<pre>ant javadoc</pre>
<p>This will build javadocs from public classes, displaying only the public methods and fields. In general, this is all the information you will need. If you need more details, such as private or protected classes, you can generate the corresponding javadoc by doing, for example:
</p>
<pre>ant -Daccess=private javadoc</pre>

<h2><a name="demos">Demos</a></h2>

  <p>Sphinx-4 contains a number of demo programs:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="tests/live/README.html">Live Demo</a>: shows the basic speech recognition capabilites via a graphical user interface</li>
    </ul>
  </li>


<hr>

<h2>Sphinx-4 for Users</h2>

<ul>

  <li><a name="configuration"><b>Configuration (Sphinx Properties)</b></a>
<p>The system behavior is determined by SphinxProperties, which make use, and therefore are similar in nature, to the Java Platform Properties class. The SphinxProperties can be defined at command line, but in general it is defined from a file with extension ".props". Properties defined in
the props file are overridden by properties defined as command line
arguments when you run the program.
</p>
<p>The properties can be a number, so you can define, using the
properties, that the FeatureVectorLength is 39, or that the logBase is
1.0001. It can be a Boolean, so you may be defining that the
property "islooping" in the class "SimpleWordListGrammar" in the
"Linguist" package is true or false.
</p>
<p>It can be a string, for example defining that the format of the
acoustic model is sphinx3.ascii.
</p>
<p>Or it can be the name of a class. You may be defining that the
linguist used is the SimpleWordListGrammar, and this is the linguist
that will be loaded at run time. Notice that you can change the class
to be used without the need to recompile code.
</p>
<p>How do you know property names, and what their default values are?
The Java platform has a tool named Javadoc, which extracts information
from comments in the source code and creates a set of html files
documenting the API and the constants in the code. You can visit the
<a
href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc/constant-values.html">
constant field values page</a> or the <a
href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc">API page</a>.
</p>
<p>For each class, the properties are defined as constant
fields. The page displays the type of variable, whether an int or float or
Boolean or something else, and the property's name and default value.
</p>
<p>For example, the class edu.cmu.sphinx.frontend.Preemphasizer
defines a property that internally, in the code, is named
PROP_PREEMPHASIS_FACTOR. This is not the name seen from outside, not
the name used in a props file. This is the internal name, used in the
code. This is a string, and the value,
edu.cmu.sphinx.frontend.preemphasizer.factor, is the name seen from
the outside. If you want to use this property in a props file, this is
the name you have to refer to.
</p>
<p>Immediately following this property, there is another field with
"_DEFAULT" appended to the previous field name, that is,
PROP_PREEMPHASIS_FACTOR_DEFAULT. This field is the default value for
this property. If the props file makes no reference to the property,
this is the value the property will have. The field definition
contains the type of constant that can be used. So, if this field is
int, only an integer can be used as the value for this property.
</p>

  <br>&nbsp;

  <li><a name="how_build"><b>Building Sphinx-4</b></a>
      <p>The prerequisites for building Sphinx-4 are as follows:
      <br>&nbsp;
      <ul>
         <li><b>Sphinx-4 Source Distribution</b>. We recommend that you
	     download the cvs source tree from SourceForge. 
         </li>
         <li><b>Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard
             Edition, v1.4</b> available at 
             <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">
             http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/</a> (all platforms).  After you
             have downloaded and installed the SDK, remember to set your
             <code><b>JAVA_HOME</b></code> environment variable to point to
             where you installed the SDK.
         </li><br>
         <li><b>Apache Ant 1.5.3</b> or
             better.  After you install ant, sure the "ant" command is in
             your path.  Visit the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache
             Ant site</a> to get ant.
         </li><br>
      </ul>
    <p>To build Sphinx-4, merely type the following in a command prompt 
       situated at the top level Sphinx-4 directory:
      <ul>
         <p><code>ant</code>
      </ul>
    <p>This executes the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
       command to build the FreeTTS classes, voices, demos, and jar files.
       The output will be placed under the <code>bld</code> directory.

    <p>We have also provided a number of ant targets for convenience:
    <ul>
       <p><code>ant clean</code>: deletes all the output from the build 
          to give you a fresh start
       <br><code>ant javadoc</code>: builds the javadoc documentation and
          places the results in the <code>javadoc</code> directory
    </ul>
  </li>

  <br>

  <li><a name="batch_tests"><b>Running the Batch Tests</b></a>

  <p>In order to run the batch regression tests, you will need to have
     any or all of the following test data (unless otherwise noted, 
     must be acquired from external sources, mostly from the
     <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu">Language Data Consortium (LDC)</a>:
     <ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC93S9">TI46</a> - isolated speech</li>

     </ul>
  
  <p>
  The Sphinx-4 regression tests have different directories for the
  different tasks. The directory sphinx4/tests/performance contains 
  directories named ti46, tidigits, an4, rm1, hub4 and some other tests. 
  Each of these directories contains a build.xml with targets specific 
  to the particular task. The build.xml allows you to run a number of 
  different tests. Type:
  <pre>ant -projecthelp</pre>
  to list a help text with the possible targets.

  <p>
  <b>Isolated Digits</b>
  <pre>
  % cd sphinx4/tests/performance/ti46
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant ti46_wordlist
  </pre>

  <p>
  <b>Connected Digits</b>
  <pre>
  % cd sphinx4/tests/performance/tidigits
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant tidigits_flat_unigram
  </pre>

  <p>
  <b>Small Vocabulary</b>

  <pre>
  % cd tests/performance/hub4
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant hub4_trigram
  </pre>

  <p>
  <b>Customizing the regression test to your environment</b>
  <p>
  All the batch regression tests are driven by properties files (they end
  with ".props") and batch files that list all the files to test (they end
  with ".batch"). You need to change the directory paths within these
  files to match your environment. Using TIDIGITS (tests/performance/tidigits/)
  as an example, here are the things to change:
  <ul>
    <li>location of the acoustic model (in tidigits.props)</li>
    <li>location of the dictionary (in tidigits.props)</li>
    <li>the batch file (tidigits.batch) - We recommend that you create
    your own batch file based on your test database. Each line in the
    batch file simply lists the fully qualified path of the test file,
    and the transcript of the test file.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  </li>
