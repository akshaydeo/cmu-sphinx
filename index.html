<h2>General Information about Sphinx-4</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a name="what_is_sphinx4"><b>Introduction</b></a>
      <p>Sphinx-4 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system
	 written entirely in the Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup>
	 programming language.
         It was created via a joint collaboration between the Sphinx group
	 at Carnegie Mellon University, Sun Microsystems Laboratories,
	 Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab (MERL), and Hewlett Packard (HP),
	 with contributions from the University of California at Santa
         Cruz (UCSC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
         (MIT).

      <p>Sphinx-4 started out as a port of Sphinx-3 to the
         Java(TM) programming language, but evolved into a recognizer
         designed to be much more flexible than Sphinx-3, thus
         becoming an excellent platform for speech research.

  <br>&nbsp;
  <li><a name="speed_and_accuracy"><b>Performance</b></a>
      <p>Sphinx-4 is a very flexible system capable of performing many
         different types of recognition tasks.  As such, it is
         difficult to characterize the performance and accuracy of
         Sphinx-4 with just a few simple numbers such as speech and
         accuracy.  Instead, we regularly run regression tests on
         Sphinx-4 to determine how it performs under a variety of
         tasks.  These tasks and their latest results are as follows
         (each task is progressively more difficult than the previous
	 task):
      <ul>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/IsolatedDigitsResults.html">
              Isolated Digits (TI46)</a>: Runs Sphinx-4 with pre-recorded
              test data to gather performance metrics for recognizing
              just one word at a time.  The vocabulary is merely the
              spoken digits from 0 through 9, with a single utterance
              containing just one digit.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ConnectedDigitsResults.html">
              Connected Digits (TIDIGITS)</a>: Extends the Isolated
              Digits test to recognize more than one word at a time
              (i.e., continuous speech).  The vocabulary is merely the
              spoken digits from 0 through 9, with a single utterance
              containing a
	      sequence of digits.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/SmallVocabResults.html">
              Small Vocabulary (AN4)</a>: Extends the vocabulary
	      to approximately 100 words, with input data ranging
	      from speaking words as well as spelling words out
	      letter by letter.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>

<li><a name="download_and_install"><b>Required software</b></a>

      <p>Sphinx-4 has been built and tested on the Solaris<sup> <font
      size="-1">TM</font></sup> Operating Environment, Mac OS X, Linux
      and Win32 operating systems. Running, building, and testing 
      Sphinx-4 requires additional software. Before you start, 
      you will need the following software available on your machine.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.4</b> or better. 
      Go to <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>,
      and select "J2SE". Download the latest version. At the time of writing,
      the latest release version is 1.4.2.
      </li>

  <br>
  <li><b>Ant 1.5.3</b> or better, available at <a
  href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a>. At the time of writing, the latest version is 1.6.0. The site has a manual with instructions on how to download, install, and use ant. The gist of it, just to get started:
  <ul>
  <li> On <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a> click on
  "binary distributions" under "Download", on the left-hand side.
  </li>

  <li> Go to the title "Current release of ant", and select the
  archive file of your preference. The most common formats are
  "tar.gz" and "zip". Clicking on any of them should start downloading
  the file to your machine.
  </li>
  <li> Save the file locally, and extract the files from the
  archive. On Windows machines, clicking on the archive file should
  start "WinZip". On Unix/Linux machines, depending on which file you
  chose, you'll need to "unzip" or "gunzip" and subsequently "tar xf"
  the file.
  </li>
  <li> After extracting the files from the archive, you'll get a
  directory named something like "apache-ant-1.6.0". Rename this
  directory to "ant", and move it to a convenient location. On Windows
  machines, this location is usually "c:\ant". On Unix/linux, this
  location is usually "/usr/local/ant".
  </li>
  <li> Define variables to support ant. This will depend on your platform:
  <ul>
  <li> Windows
  <pre>
set ANT_HOME=c:\ant
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Unix (bash)
  <pre>
export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/ant
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Unix (csh)
  <pre>
setenv ANT_HOME /usr/local/ant
set path=( $path $ANT_HOME/bin )
</pre>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Installation of ant is complete.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <br>
  <li> <b>CVS</b> and <b>SSH</b>, but only if you want to interact directly
  with the cvs tree (which we recommend). The canonical places to get them 
  are <a href="http://www.cvshome.org">www.cvshome.org</a> and
  <a href="http://openssh.org">openssh.org</a>. If you are using Windows,
  your best choice is to install <a
  href="http://cygwin.com">cygwin</a>, which will give you a
  linux-like environment in a command prompt window. Make sure to
  choose "ssh" and "cvs" when you install cygwin.
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>

      <li><a name="source"><b>Sphinx-4 source distribution</b></a>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<ul>
	  <li><a name="cvs"><b>Instructions for retrieving code from the cvs trees</b></a>
	    <p>The Sphinx-4 code is located at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx">sourceforge.net</a> as open source. Please follow the instructions below to retrieve it.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Make sure that you set the environment variable CVS_RSH to
		ssh. See the <a href="#faq">troubleshooting</a> section for more
		details.
	      </li>

	      <li>Get the code from sourceforge.net. If you are a
	      developer in the cmusphinx project, then do:
		<pre>% cvs -d:ext:cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx co sphinx4</pre>
	      </li>
	  <li>If you are not a developer, you have to get the code
	  anonymously. When prompted for a password, simply hit
	  &lt;ENTER&gt;:

	    <pre>
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx login

	<p>There are no release packages avaibable at this time for Sphinx-4.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<br>
<li><a name="language_models"><b>Language Models</b></a>

<p>The language model used by Sphinx-4 follows the ARPA
format. Language models provided with the acoustic model packages were
created with the Carnegie Mellon University Statistical Language
Modeling toolkit (CMU SLM toolkit), available <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM_info.html">at CMU</a>. A manual
is available there.</p>

<p>The language model is created from a list of transcriptions. Given
a file with training transcription, the following script
creates a list of words that appear in the transcriptions, then
creates a bigram and a trigram LM files in the ARPA format. The file with extension ccs contains the context cues, and it is usually a list of words used as markers - beginning or end of speech etc.</p>

<pre>
set task = RM

# Location of the CMU SLM toolkit
set bindir = ~/src/CMU-SLM_Toolkit_v2/bin

cat $task.transcript | $bindir/text2wfreq | $bindir/wfreq2vocab > $task.vocab

set mode = "-absolute"

# Create bigram
cat $task.transcript | $bindir/text2idngram -n 2 -vocab $task.vocab | \
   $bindir/idngram2lm $mode -context $task.ccs -n 2 -vocab $task.vocab \
   -idngram - -arpa $task.bigram.arpa

# Create trigram

<p>
If you want to build the javadocs, go to the top level directory ("sphinx4"),
and type:
</p>
<pre>ant javadoc</pre>
<p>This will build javadocs from public classes, displaying only the public methods and fields. In general, this is all the information you will need. If you need more details, such as private or protected classes, you can generate the corresponding javadoc by doing, for example:
</p>
<pre>ant -Daccess=private javadoc</pre>

<h2>Sphinx-4 for Users</h2>

<ul>

  <li><a name="configuration"><b>Configuration (Sphinx Properties)</b></a>

  <p>The system behavior is determined by SphinxProperties, which is similar
     in nature to the Java Platform Properties class. The SphinxProperties
     can be defined at command line, but in general it is defined from a file
     with extension ".props". Properties defined in the props file are
     overridden by properties defined as command line arguments when you run
     the program.
  </p>

  <p>The properties can be a number (int, float, double), a boolean, a string,
     or the name of a class. For example, you can define the 
     FeatureVectorLength is 39, or that the logBase is 1.0001, or that
     the property "islooping" in the class "SimpleWordListGrammar" in the
     "Linguist" package is true or false.
     It can also be the name of a class. You may be defining that the
     grammar used is the SimpleWordListGrammar, and this is the grammar
     that will be loaded at run time. Notice that you can change the class
     to be used without the need to recompile code.
  </p>

  <p>A property is specified as follows:

  <p><code>edu.cmu.sphinx.knowledge.acoustic.tiedstate.TiedStateAcousticModel.format = sphinx3.binary</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>That is, the full name of the property (edu.cmu.sphinx.knowledge.acoustic.tiedstate.TiedStateAcousticModel.format), followed by "=", followed by the value of the property (sphinx3.binary).

  </p>

  <p>How do you know what the property names and their default values are?
     The Java platform has a tool named Javadoc, which extracts information
     from comments in the source code and creates a set of local html files
     documenting the <a href="./javadoc">API</a> and the
     <a href="./javadoc/constant-values.html">constants</a> in the code.
     If you have access to the web, you can visit the
     <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc/constant-values.html">constant field values page</a> 
     or the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc">API page</a> located at sourceforge.net.
  </p>

  <p>For each class, the properties are defined as constant fields.
     The constant field value page displays the type of variable,
     whether an int or float or boolean or something else,
     and the property's name and default value.
  </p>

  <p>For example, the class edu.cmu.sphinx.frontend.Preemphasizer
     defines a property that internally, in the code, is named
     PROP_PREEMPHASIS_FACTOR. This is not the name seen from outside,
     not the name used in a props file. This is the internal name,
     used in the code. This is a string, and the value,
     "edu.cmu.sphinx.frontend.preemphasizer.factor", is used in the properties
     file to specify the preemphasis factor.
  </p>

  <p>Immediately following this property, there is another field with
     "_DEFAULT" appended to the previous field name, that is,
     PROP_PREEMPHASIS_FACTOR_DEFAULT. This field is the default value for
     this property. If the props file makes no reference to the property,
     this is the value the property will have. The field definition
     contains the type of constant that can be used. So, if this field is
     int, only an integer can be used as the value for this property.
  </p>

  </li>
<li><a name="faq"><b>Troublehooting/FAQ</b></a><br>&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li>How can I specify the location of the Java JDK?
    <ul>

      <li>Using the JAVA_HOME environment variable. For the different
      versions of OS, do:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unix (t)csh: <code>setenv JAVA_HOME /lab/speech/java/j2sdk1.4.0</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Unix (ba)sh: <code>export JAVA_HOME='/lab/speech/java/jdk1.4.1_01'</code>
          </li>

          <li>
            Windows/cygwin: <code>export JAVA_HOME='c:/Progra~1/J2SDK_Forte/jdk1.4.0'</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <br>  

  <li>How can I update the code in the the current working copy that I
  have?
    <ul>

      <li>If you are using CVS, you can do a "cvs update -d". The
      switch "-d" will also get new directories or files that have
      been added to the cvs module since the last time you
      downloaded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>I always get a "timeout" message when I try to download/update
  the cvs tree.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you defined the CVS_RSH environment variable as
      'ssh'. If ssh is not on your path, make sure you specify the
      full path. For the different versions of OS, do:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unix (t)csh: <code>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</code>

          </li>
          <li>
            Unix (ba)sh: <code>export CVS_RSH='/usr/local/bin/ssh'</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Windows/cygwin: <code>export CVS_RSH='ssh'</code>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <li>Make sure that you install "ssh" and "cvs" when you install
    cygwin. If you do not want to go through the list of packages
    trying to decide what you need, installing everything is a good
    solution.
    </li>
    <li>Cygwin does not define a home directory, which is used by
    cvs. You have to explicitly define it. You are better off creating
    an environment variable HOME, which will be used by every cygwin
    window that you open. Follow the instructions below to create this
    variable on Windows 2000.
    <ul>

	<li>Assume your userid is "johndoe", and you created a
	directory named "/home/johndoe" in the cygwin environment
        </li>
        <li>Right click on the "My Computer" icon
	</li>
	<li>On the menu, click on "Properties"
	</li>
	<li>Click the "Advanced" tab
	</li>
	<li>Select "Environment Variables"
	</li>
	<li>Click "New" on the "User variables for johndoe" box
	</li>

	<li>On "Variable Name", type "HOME"
	</li>
	<li>On "Variable Value", type "c:\cygwin\home\johndoe"
	</li>
    </ul>
    When you start a new cygwin window, if you type "echo $HOME", you
    should get "/home/johndoe".
    </li>
    <li>Handling absolute paths: Cygwin interprets directory paths in
    a unix-like way, relative to its own "root" directory (which
    cygwin sees as "/" but Windows sees as "c:\cygwin"). However, the
    Java platform interprets directory paths via the operating
    system. Therefore, absolute paths, such as "/lab/speech", will be
    interpreted differently by cygwin and by the Java platform. One
    workaround is to keep the absolute path in Windows (e.g.
    "c:\lab\") and create a link, in cygwin, from that location (such
    as "ln -s /cygdrive/c/lab /lab"). If you use absolute paths to
    identify data location and the directories are not setup this way,
    you may encounter error messages such as:
    </li>
    <pre>
d:\work\sphinx4&gt;ant clean 
/c: Can't open /c: No such file or directory 
</pre>
    <li>Handling DOS 8.3 filename format: Since cygwin deals with unix
    and DOS filename formats at the same time, filenames in different
    files (e.g., build.xml, .props file) have different
    requirements. Paths interpreted directly by cygwin can be as long
    as you want. Paths passed to the program, though, conform to the
    8.3 convention of DOS filenames. Therefore you have to define the
    path to, say, junit as something like
    /lab/speech/ThirdP~1/junit3.7, since this string is passed from
    the environment to the Java code to the OS. </li>

  <li><a name="how_build"><b>Building Sphinx-4</b></a>
      <p>The prerequisites for building Sphinx-4 are as follows. See section <a href="#download_and_install">Required software</a> for instructions on how to obtain the software listed below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Sphinx-4 Source Distribution</b>. We recommend that you
	     download the cvs source tree from SourceForge. 
         </li>
         <li><b>Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard
             Edition, v1.4</b> available at 
             <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">
             http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/</a> (all platforms).  After you
             have downloaded and installed the SDK, remember to set your
             <code><b>JAVA_HOME</b></code> environment variable to point to
             where you installed the SDK.
         </li><br>
         <li><b>Apache Ant 1.5.3</b> or
             better.  After you install ant, make sure the "ant" command is in
             your path.  Visit the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache
             Ant site</a> to get ant.
         </li><br>
      </ul>
    <p>To build Sphinx-4, from a command prompt, make sure you have changed to the directory where you installed Sphinx-4 (usually, a simple "cd sphinx4" will do), and merely type the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <p><code>ant</code>
      </ul>
    <p>This executes the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
       command to build the Sphinx-4 classes, demos, and jar files.
       The output will be placed under the <code>bld</code> directory.

    <p>We have also provided a number of ant targets for convenience:
    <ul>
       <p><code>ant clean</code>: deletes all the output from the build 
          to give you a fresh start
       <br><a href="#create_javadocs"><code>ant javadoc</code></a>: builds the javadoc documentation and
          places the results in the <code>javadoc</code> directory
    </ul>
  </li>

  <br>

  <li><a name="batch_tests"><b>Running the Batch Tests</b></a>

  <p>
  Sphinx-4 contains a number of regression tests using common speech databases.
  In order to run the batch regression tests, you will need to have
  any or all of the following test data. The links will lead you to an
  outside site where you can acquire them. Data from the <a
  href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu">Language Data Consortium (LDC)</a>
  are available from a fee. Data from other sources may be free.
  </p>
     <ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC93S9">TI46</a> - isolated speech</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC93S10">TIDIGITS</a> - connected digits</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/databases/an4/">AN4</a> - 
         small vocabulary alphanumeric connect speech</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC93S3B">RM1</a> - medium vocabulary connected speech
     <li><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2000S88">HUB4</a> - large vocabulary connected speech</li>
     </ul>
  
  <p>
  The Sphinx-4 regression tests have different directories for the
  different tasks. The directory sphinx4/tests/performance contains 
  directories named ti46, tidigits, an4, rm1, hub4, and some other tests. 
  Each of these directories contains a build.xml with targets specific 
  to the particular task. The build.xml allows you to run a number of 
  different tests. Type:
  <pre>ant -projecthelp</pre>
  to list a help text with the possible targets.

  <p>
  <b>Isolated Digits</b>
  <pre>
  % cd sphinx4/tests/performance/ti46
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant ti46_wordlist
</pre>

  <p>
  <b>Connected Digits</b>
  <pre>
  % cd sphinx4/tests/performance/tidigits
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant tidigits_flat_unigram
</pre>

  <p>
  <b>Small Vocabulary</b>
  <pre>
  % cd sphinx4/tests/performance/an4
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant an4_words_unigram
</pre>
  
  <p>
  <b>Medium Vocabulary</b>
  <pre>
  % cd sphinx4/tests/performance/rm1
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant rm1_bigram
</pre>

  <p>
  <b>Large Vocabulary</b>
  <pre>
  % cd tests/performance/hub4
  % ant -projecthelp      # to see a list of possible targets
  % ant hub4_trigram
</pre>

  <p>
  <b>Customizing the regression test to your environment</b>
  <p>
  All the batch regression tests are driven by properties files (they end
  with ".props") and batch files that list all the files to test (they end
  with ".batch"). You need to change the directory paths within these
  files to match your environment. Using TIDIGITS (tests/performance/tidigits/)
  as an example, here are the things to change:
  <ul>
    <li>location of the acoustic model (in tidigits.props)</li>
    <li>location of the dictionary (in tidigits.props)</li>
    <li>the batch file (tidigits.batch) - We recommend that you create
    your own batch file based on your test database. Each line in the
    batch file simply lists the fully qualified path of the test file,
    and the transcript of the test file.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  </li>
</ul>
