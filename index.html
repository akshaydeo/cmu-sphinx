<h2>General Information about Sphinx-4</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a name="what_is_sphinx4"><b>Introduction</b></a>
      <p>Sphinx-4 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system
	 written entirely in the Java
         <sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> programming language.
         It was created via a joint collaboration between Carnegie
         Mellon's Sphinx group, Sun Microsystems, Mitsubishi Electric
         Research Lab (MERL), and Hewlett Packard (HP), with
         contributions from the University of California at Santa
         Cruz (UCSC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
         (MIT).

      <p>Sphinx-4 started out as a port of Sphinx-3 to the
         Java(TM) programming language, but evolved into a recognizer
         designed to be much more flexible than Sphinx-3, thus
         becoming an excellent platform for speech research.
  </li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  <li><a name="capabilities"><b>Capabilities</b></a>
      <p>[[[WDW: FIXME - these are just notes.  Should include links
         into the javadoc]]].
      <p>Discrete and continous speech.  
      <p>Generalized front end feature extraction.  Includes pluggable
         implementations of preemphasis, Hamming window, FFT, Mel
         frequency filter bank, discrete cosine transform, and
	 feature extraction of cepstra, delta cepstra, double delta
	 cepstra features.
      <p>Generalized pluggable language model architecture.  Includes
         pluggable language model support for unigram, bigram,
         trigram, Java Speech API JSGF, and FST grammars.  
      <p>Generalized acoustic model architecture.  Includes pluggable
         support for sphinx-3 acoustic models.
      <p>Generalized search management.  Includes pluggable support
         for simple breadth first and word pruning searches.
  </li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  <li><a name="speed_and_accuracy"><b>Performance</b></a>
      <p>Sphinx-4 is a very flexible system capable of performing many
         different types of recognition tasks.  As such, it is
         difficult to characterize the performance and accuracy of
         Sphinx-4 with just a few simple numbers such as speech and
         accuracy.  Instead, we regularly run regression tests on
         Sphinx-4 to determine how it performs under a variety of
         tasks.  These tasks and their latest results are as follows
         (each task is progressively more difficult than the previous
	 task):
      <ul>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/IsolatedDigitsResults.html">
              Isolated Digits (TI46)</a>: Runs Sphinx-4 with pre-recorded
              test data to gather performance metrics for recognizing
              just one word at a time.  The vocabulary is merely the
              spoken digits from 0 through 9, with a single utterance
              containing just one digit.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ConnectedDigitsResults.html">
              Connected Digits (TIDIGITS)</a>: Extends the Isolated
              Digits test to recognize more than one word at a time
              (i.e., continuous speech).  The vocabulary is merely the
              spoken digits from 0 through 9, with a single utterance
              containing a
	      sequence of digits.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/SmallVocabResults.html">
              Small Vocabulary (AN4)</a>: Extends the vocabulary
	      to approximately 100 words, with input data ranging
	      from speaking words as well as spelling words out
	      letter by letter.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/MediumVocabResults.html">
              Medium Vocabulary (RM1)</a>: Extends the vocabulary
	      to approximately 1000 words.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/LargeVocabResults.html">
              Large Vocabulary (HUB4)</a>: Extends the vocabulary
	      to approximately 1000 words.
          </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  <li><a name="download_and_install"><b>Downloading and Installing</b></a>
      <p>Include notes on acoustic model and language model files.
      <p>Sphinx-4 has been build and tested on the Solaris<sup>
         <font size="-1">TM</font></sup> Operating Environment, Mac OS X,
         Linux and Win32 operating systems.  
      <p>Running, building, and testing Sphinx-4 requires the
         Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 1.4.  You can download
         the developer kit from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">
         http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/</a>.  Make sure you set your
         JAVA_HOME environment variable to point your installation (e.g.,
         JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0).

      <p>Describe Sphinx4Properties philosophy and include pointer to 
         various files that define particular Sphinx-4 properties.

  <br>&nbsp;
  <li><a name="how_build"><b>Building Sphinx-4</b></a>
      <p>The prerequisites for building Sphinx-4 are as follows:
      <br>&nbsp;
      <ul>
         <li><b>Sphinx-4 Source Distribution</b>.  Download from ...
         </li>
         <li><b>Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard
             Edition, v1.4</b> available at 
             <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">
             http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/</a> (all platforms).  After you
             have downloaded and installed the SDK, remember to set your
             <code><b>JAVA_HOME</b></code> environment variable to point to
             where you installed the SDK.
         </li><br>
         <li><b>Apache Ant 1.5.3</b> or
             better.  After you install ant, sure the "ant" command is in
             your path.  Visit the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache
             Ant site</a> to get ant.
         </li><br>
      </ul>
    <p>To build Sphinx-4, merely type the following in a command prompt 
       situated at the top level Sphinx-4 directory:
      <ul>
         <p><code>ant</code>
      </ul>
    <p>This executes the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
       command to build the FreeTTS classes, voices, demos, and jar files.
       The output will be placed under the <code>bld</code> directory.

    <p>We have also provided a number of ant targets for convenience:
    <ul>
       <p><code>ant clean</code>: deletes all the output from the build 
          to give you a fresh start
       <br><code>ant javadoc</code>: builds the javadoc documentation and
          places the results in the <code>javadoc</code> directory
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
