PBL - 6/21/04 - 
    Added the DynamicFlatLinguist. This linguist supports
    C&C style grammars (such as JSGF grammars). It differs from the simple
    FlatLinguist in that it can load much larger and more perplex grammars,
    loads them much more quickly and uses less memory. Currently this
    linguist runs slower than the simple FlatLinguist. Performance work is
    underway.
